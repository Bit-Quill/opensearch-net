== Installation

This page is about about how to install the `OpenSearch.Net` and the `NEST`
clients.

=== Installing the OpenSearch.Net client

The low level client, `OpenSearchLowLevelClient`, is a low level, dependency free 
client that has no opinions about how you build and represent your requests and 
responses. 

It can be installed from the Package Manager Console inside Visual Studio by 
using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
Install-Package OpenSearch.Net
----

Or by searching for 
https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenSearch.Net[OpenSearch.Net] in the 
Package Manager GUI.

[[es-nest]]
[discrete]
=== Installing the NEST client

The high level `OpenSearchClient`, provides a strongly typed query DSL that maps 
one-to-one with the {opensearch} query DSL.

It can be installed from the Package Manager Console inside Visual Studio by 
using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
Install-Package NEST
----

Or by searching for https://www.nuget.org/packages/NEST[NEST] in the Package 
Manager GUI. 

NEST internally uses and still exposes the low level client, 
`OpenSearchLowLevelClient`, from <<opensearch-net,OpenSearch.Net>> via the 
`.LowLevel` property on `OpenSearchClient`.
